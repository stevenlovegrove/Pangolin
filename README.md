What is Pangolin
====================================

Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing OpenGL
display / interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is a simple
OpenGl viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D visualisation without
adding to its complexity, and offers an advanced but intuitive 3D navigation
handler. Pangolin also provides a mechanism for manipulating program variables
through config files and ui integration, and has a flexible real-time plotter
for visualising graphical data.

The ethos of Pangolin is to reduce the boilerplate code that normally
gets written to visualise and interact with (typically image and 3D
based) systems, without compromising performance. It also enables write-once
code for a number of platforms, currently including Windows, Linux, OSX, Android
and IOS.

* CUDA Toolkit >= 3.2 (Some CUDA header-only interop utilities included)
  * http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

* Doxygen for generating html / pdf documentation.

## Building ##

Pangolin uses the CMake portable pre-build tool. To checkout and build pangolin in the
directory 'build', execute the following at a shell (or the equivelent using a GUI):

```
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
cd Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

If you would like to build the documentation and you have Doxygen installed, you
can execute:

```
cmake --build . --target doc
```

**On Windows**, Pangolin will attempt to download and build *glew*, *libjpeg*, *libpng* and *zlib* automatically. It does so assuming that git is available on the path - this assumption may be wrong for windows users who have downloaded Pangolin via a zip file on github. You will instead need to download and compile the dependencies manually, and set the BUILD_EXTERN_(lib) options to false for these libraries. The alternate and recommended approach is to install [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and work from within their provided console.

## Issues ##

Please visit [Github Issues](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin/issues) to view and report problems with Pangolin. Issues and pull requests should be raised against the master branch which contains the current development version.

Please note; most Pangolin dependencies are optional - to disable a dependency which may be causing trouble on your machine, set the BUILD_PANGOLIN_(option) variable to false with a cmake configuration tool (e.g. ccmake or cmake-gui).

## Contributions and Continuous Integration ##

For CI, Pangolin uses [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for Ubuntu, OSX and [ci.appveyor.com](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stevenlovegrove/pangolin) for Windows.

To contribute to Pangolin, I would appreciate pull requests against the master branch. This will trigger CI builds for your changes automatically, and help me to merge with confidence.

## Binaries ##

Binaries are available for Windows x64, as output by the Windows CI server: [Appveyor Artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stevenlovegrove/pangolin/build/artifacts).

## Bindings ##

### Python ###

Pangolin python bindings are enabled via [pybind11](www.pybind11.com). These bindings can be used both standalone and from within Pangolin's drop-down console (press the back-tick key, `).

To enable the bindings, you must checkout the pybind submodule. To use pangolin in python, it's recommend to install a few other python packages too:

```
sudo python -mpip install numpy pyopengl Pillow pybind11
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

The python module pypangolin must be on your python path, either through installation, or by setting it explicitly:

```
import sys
sys.path.append('path/of/pypangolin.so')
```

## Scheme syntax for windowing and video

Pangolin uses 'URI' syntax for modularising video drivers and windowing backends. The syntax follows along the lines of `module_name:[option1=value1,option2=value2,...]//module_resource_to_open`. Some examples for using this URI syntax with the VideoViewer tool is as follows:

```
VideoViewer test://
VideoViewer uvc:[size=640x480]///dev/video0
VideoViewer flip://debayer:[tile=rggb,method=downsample]//file://~/somefile.pango
```

Notice that for video, some modules support chaining to construct a simple filter graph. See include/pangolin/video/video.h for more examples.

For windowing, you can also customize default arguments for Pangolin applications by setting the `PANGOLIN_WINDOW_URI` environment variable. For instance, on high-DPI screens (in this example on OSX), you could set:


```
setenv PANGOLIN_WINDOW_URI "cocoa:[HIGHRES=true]//"
```

Some window parameters that may be interesting to override are `DISPLAYNAME`, `DOUBLEBUFFER`, `SAMPLE_BUFFERS`, `SAMPLES`, `HIGHRES`. Window modules currently include `x11`, `winapi`, `cocoa`.

## Acknowledgements ##

I'd like to thank the growing number of kind contributors to Pangolin for helping to make it more stable and feature rich. Many features of Pangolin have been influenced by other projects such as GFlags, GLConsole, and libcvd in particular. I'd also like to thank the FOSS projects on which Pangolin depends.

For a summary of those who have made code contributions, execute:

```
git shortlog -sne
