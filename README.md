What is Pangolin {#mainpage}
====================================

Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing OpenGL
display / interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is a simple
OpenGl viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D visualisation without
adding to its complexity, and offers an advanced but intuitive 3D navigation
handler. Pangolin also provides a mechanism for manipulating program variables
through config files and ui integration, and has a flexible real-time plotter
for visualising graphical data.

The ethos of Pangolin is to reduce the boilerplate code that normally
gets written to visualise and interact with (typically image and 3D
based) systems, without compromising performance. It also enables write-once
code for a number of platforms, currently including Windows, Linux, OSX, Android
and IOS.

## Building ##

Pangolin uses the CMake portable pre-build tool. To checkout and build pangolin in the
directory 'build', execute the following at a shell (or the equivelent using a GUI):

```
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
cd Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

If you would like to build the documentation and you have Doxygen installed, you
can execute:

```
make doc
```

## Issues ##

Please visit [Github Issues](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin/issues) to view and report problems with Pangolin. Issues and pull requests should be raised against the devel branch which contains the current development version.

Please note; most Pangolin dependencies are optional - to disable a dependency which may be causing trouble on your machine, simply blank out it's include and library directories with a cmake configuration tool (e.g. ccmake or cmake-gui).
